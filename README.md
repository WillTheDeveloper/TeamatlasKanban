# Welcome to TeamATLAS Kanban repository.

## Purpose of this Kanban board

The reason I have decided to create this kanban board is to allow us to track progress on currect projects and future ones. It also allows for updates to be
sent to people who need that kind of information.

Github's kanban system is quite good and it is due to be updated with its new roadmap features but what I hope that this will allow me to do is have it automatically email the people we work with of updates on the project we are doing for them if we was to do that allowing for clients to constantly be in the loop of the project.

If I was to implement the Github API into the kanban site then it would mean that I won't have to come to git to do everything that I need to do and I could probably create a neat dashboard to allow me to overview everything that I am working on with progress bars and a list of issues that are assigned to me. On second thought, it would also mean that I have to be able to connect accounts to Github directly to allow for that interaction for authentication purposes but I am sure that won't be too much of a struggle ones I dig around on the internet for answers.

Since I will be making it, it will also mean that I will be able to design it how I like with all the features that I thing it should have that will set it apart from every other kanban you can find on the internet.

## Features of this kanban

* Once I figure it out I would like to implement Github API so we can create and view github issues from the website and manage the repo that way.

## Software/Packages this will utilize

The entire thing will run on the Laravel Framework.

The packages that I plan to include are as follows:

* Breeze - This will allow me to have basic authentication come installed on my project with 2FA and email verification and then all I need to do is build
the dashboard itself for people to use.
* Tailwind - Well, I want it to look very nice so this comes as standard.
* Livewire - I want to be able to reuse components so I will be using that for this and the very efficient looping over for database collections.
* Vapor - It's going to be hosted on vapor using serverless technology. It will also allow for me to use continuous intergration with this repository to make sure everything is up to date.

## Other requirements

* This website will be very heavily dependant on a database which will be hosted inside AWS RDS.

## Roadmap

I have other projects to work on at the moment so it will be a while before I do this. At the moment this is just an idea that I have had and put into Github.
It helps because then I will never forget about it unless I am unfortunate enough to lose my github account which I hope will never happen since Github is my
favourite tool when it comes to programming.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.
