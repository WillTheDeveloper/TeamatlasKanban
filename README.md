# Welcome to TeamATLAS Kanban repository.

## Purpose of this Kanban board

The reason I have decided to create this kanban board is to allow us to track progress on currect projects and future ones. It also allows for updates to be
sent to people who need that kind of information.

## Features of this kanban

* Once I figure it out I would like to implement Github API so we can create and view github issues from the website and manage the repo that way.

## Roadmap

I have other projects to work on at the moment so it will be a while before I do this. At the moment this is just an idea that I have had and put into Github.
It helps because then I will never forget about it unless I am unfortunate enough to lose my github account which I hope will never happen since Github is my
favourite tool when it comes to programming.
